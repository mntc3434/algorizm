# Linked List Implementation in C++

## Description
This project provides a simple implementation of a singly linked list in C++. A linked list is a dynamic data structure that consists of nodes, where each node contains a value (`data`) and a pointer to the next node (`next`).

The linked list supports basic operations like:
- Adding nodes at the beginning or end of the list.
- Deleting a node by its value.
- Displaying the entire list.

## Features
- **Dynamic memory allocation:** The linked list grows and shrinks as needed.
- **Node operations:** Insertions and deletions are handled efficiently.
- **User-friendly output:** Displays the linked list in a readable format.

## Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming and data structures.
